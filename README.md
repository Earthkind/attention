# attention

**Problem** Approximately [35% of our attention](https://worldaftercapital.gitbook.io/worldaftercapital/part-three/trapped) is allocated to work.  Approxiamately 60% our attention goes towards consuming media.

In a world where we need so much urgent progress, 5% of our attention is not much to work with.

The purpose of this project is enabling people to reallocate their attention towards valuable, urgent, and desired causes.

Without zooming in on any solution/direction too quickly, consider that there could be many co-existent approaches to addressing the attention problem.

To go further, meet Amy.  Like much of the human population, Amy is now a remote at-home worker.  (Amy's work could be technical, administrative, design, anything.  The important detail is that Amy can work from home.)

What are some ways Amy can reallocate her attention?

### 35% - Attention allocated to work

#### Approach 1: Task Automation

Empower Amy to automate routines/repeitive processes at work, freeing the attention and time that was consumed by those tasks. (Warning: Amy must do this mindfully, as not to automate her own job away.)

If automating tasks would simply create new work for Amy, this would be less effective â€“ a net-zero change in time.

Still, even with zero gain in time, there could be benefits.  Imagine Amy's daily tasks include 8 hours of manual data entry, leaving her brain "fried" at the end of the work day, and making her attention outside of work **less capable.**

If by automating the data entry, Amy can spend 8 hours on tasks that won't leave her fried after work, then her post-work attention will be **more capable.**

#### Approach 2: Re-allocate tasks

Connect Amy with Brenda, a remote asssistant or apprentice.

Brenda can gain desired work/experience from taking on some of Amy's routines/processes, freeing Amy's attention that was consumed by those tasks.

#### Approach 3: Basic income

Provide Amy with a basic income, which enables her to reduce working hours and use her attention differently.

If a basic income is utilized, and there are many people who request a basic income, consider allocating the income in such a way that frees as much of the **most capable attention** as possible.

Example: We can allocate $1000 in monthly basic income, and we have two candidates, Andy and Zach.  All else being equal, Andy would require $1000/month in order to "exit the job loop" and reallocate his attention.  Zach would require $500/month in order to "exit the job loop" and reallocate his attention.

With all else being equal, it would make sense to prioritize freeing Zach's attention, because it costs 2x less to do so.  This means that we could help free Zach's attention for twice as long as we could Andy's (two months compared to one month), and/or we could free Zach's attention *and* other people's attention, at equal cost to freeing Andy's attention.

However, if we felt the capacity of Andy's attention was 2.5x that of Zach's (for example, if they are both programmers, and Andy can achieve desired outcomes 2.5x as quickly as Zach), then it would cost less to free Zach's attention.

(Possible tool for estimating programmer capacity: https://merico.build.)

Note: we are not required to think in terms of full-time equivalent (40 hrs/week) basic incomes.

To understand, consider two scenarios:

* A: We can free the attention of 50 people for 40 hours a week, by providing resources to supplant their full-time jobs.

* B: We can free the attention of 100 people for 20 hours a week, by providing resources to scale back their working hours.

If we can free **more capable attention** by providing 100 part-time equivalent (PTE) basic incomes than 50 full-time equivalent (PTE) basic incomes, the 100 PTE scenario would be the preferrable allocation.

But what if the actual *capacity* of people's attention increases when they can go from 20-hour working weeks to 0-hour working weeks?

If so, and 50 FTE basic incomes would free **more capable attention** than 100 BTE basic incomes, then the 50 FTE scenario would be the preferrable allocation.

To continue, we should consider Buckminister Fuller's definition of "wealth" from [*Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth*](https://www.designsciencelab.com/resources/OperatingManual_BF.pdf):

> **Wealth** is our organized capability to cope effectively with the environment in sustaining our healthy regeneration and decreasing both the physical and metaphysical restrictions of the forward days of our lives.

With this in mind, a decision for how to allocate basic income could include the following metrics:

* the potential "wealth"/value of a given problem domain 

* the capacity of a candidate's attention in a given problem domain 

* our certainty in our candidate evaluation

* our certainty in our problem evaluation

* the cost of freeing the candidate's attention 

*These metrics do not need to be applied as a rigid formula, and can operate merely as guidelines for decisionmaking.*

Note that this framework is strongly opinionated, and could have implications on fairness and equality of opportunity.  In some cases, it may skew towards people who have had systemic advantages and priveleges.  In other cases, it can skew towards people who identify lower income needs.

The metric it's after is **freeing *as much* of *the most capable* attention *as soon* as possible.** That doesn't mean this is the best approach for the intended outcome (solving problems with great societal value by allocating our attention to them), and discussion/debate is encouraged.
